Our program teaches practical martial arts, bully protection, and proven self-defense techniques. The skills we teach are not only physical techniques, but also emotional strategies about how to “find your voice” to face life with courage and determination. Students learn to stand up for themselves and their principles. We teach that physical self-defense is the last resort and rarely necessary. True self-defense starts with learning to be confident and knowing how to negotiate and get along with others. We focus on what it means to be a person of character and to never misuse our skills.&nbsp; At Kaizen IBBA, students learn so much more than just kicking and punching. They learn to avoid conflict, set and achieve goals, and many other important skills to succeed in life. Children are taught to treat others (including their siblings) with kindness and patience, while holding strong to their values.
