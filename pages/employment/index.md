Front Range Fire Rescue Authority (FRFRA) is a combination department composed of both career and Reserve firefighters. Our Reserves account for the majority of our department and we would love to have you join us. Volunteering is a great way to give back to your community and learn valuable skills along the way. As a Reserve, the department will provide you with Firefighter I, EMT-B, Hazardous Material Operations, and many other certifications. FRFRA currently holds two processes for Reserves annually.

&nbsp;

We are now accepting applications for Reserve Firefighters.&nbsp; This process is for current IFSAC FFI accredited candidates. &nbsp;Applications are available in person at Front Range Fire Rescue Station 1 (100 Telep Ave, Johnstown, CO) or Station 2 (101 S. Irene Ave, Milliken, CO 80543).&nbsp; The deadline for applications is Friday, April 15, 2016 at 5:00. &nbsp;Applications are to be submitted to Station 2 or via email to info@frfr.co
