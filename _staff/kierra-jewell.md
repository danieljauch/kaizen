Kierra has been training at Kaizen IBBA since November 2012. She began her journey after enrolling her son in the program and seeing how much fun he had while he learned new life skills. Kierra earned her 1st degree Black Belt with her husband in February 2017 and they are both currently pursuing their second degree Black Belt.&nbsp; She enjoys teaching with the level 2 & 3 Panther classes and hopes to move to teaching adults as well. She believes that martial arts have something for everyone and the most important things she has gained from her training are self-confidence and her "Ohana".&nbsp;
