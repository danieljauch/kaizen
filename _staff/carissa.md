Carissa Morris has a 2nd degree Black Belt in International Kenpo Karate Ju Jitsu and a 1st degree Black Belt in Kanda Ha Kamishin Aiki Ju Jitsu. From the time she was a blue belt, she knew that she wanted to become an instructor and has been teaching in the Fort Collins school since 2010. She has a passion for sharing the art that has changed her life. "When I started taking classes, I had no confidence in myself. I thought, how can an overweight mother of four train with these young people. After years of hard work, I know that the only person who can stop or restrict me is me. And now I can move with the best of them!"
