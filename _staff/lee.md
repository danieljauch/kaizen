He spent his childhood training in traditional Karate schools, and in his teenage years transitioned into western boxing before joining the Marine Corps in 2000. While a Marine, Sensei Urton served as an infantry team leader and received numerous awards and commendations for his service in combat during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Since his military service, Sensei Urton has attended CSU’s Health and Exercise Science program, as well as devoted his life to teaching and empowering people of all ages (particularly children) to live healthier, happier, and more active lives through Martial Arts, inspiring all his students to live up to their potential. As a father of three, Sensei Urton understands the value of Martial Arts in young people’s lives and the enormous positive impact it has on both physical and emotional health and he has made it his mission to share the Martial Arts with as many people as possible.
