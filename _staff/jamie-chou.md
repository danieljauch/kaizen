<div><p>Jamie Chou has been training at International Black Belt Academy since 2015 and earned his brown belt in July 2017. Back in Reno, NV he was training towards his green belt in Goju Kenpo before going on hiatus due to an injury. When his kids became old enough, the Chou family found a home at IBBA Fort Collins. While continuing his training as a student, Mr Chou was the first student to complete the instructor certification program. &ldquo;I love martial arts and I value making a positive difference in someone&rsquo;s life. As an instructor I am privileged and honored to do both.&rdquo;<strong></strong></p></div>
