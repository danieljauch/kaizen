I started working in the office in February of 2014 while I finished my English Education degree at CSU. I began my employment on Valentine's Day, which was appropriate since I truly fell in love with working here. I actually stumbled across the school on accident! I am so glad I did, though, because even without a background in martial arts, this school became my family. I am so lucky to work with such supportive and positive people. Since working here, I have seen the great impact martial arts can have on people's lives. One of my favorite things about working here is definitely the Black Belt Extravaganza we host twice a year. It is so inspiring to see kids and adults work towards something for so long and then get to show off their hard work.
