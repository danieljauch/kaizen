Our system is called International Kenpo Karate-Jiu Jitsu. This art is a great system for kids and adults alike. It is based on a unique and practical blend of three ancient martial art traditions including Kenpo Karate, Tae Kwon Do, and Jujitsu/Jiu Jitsu. Our students become skilled in all phases of the martial arts including many of the sporting and performance aspects of the arts, all while learning how to protect themselves from various types of danger. International Kenpo is a very well-rounded system. We have many students who come to us from Tae Kwon Do and other styles to expand their knowledge and learn this practical system. Parents and students love IBBA Karate because everyone is made to feel welcome and valued regardless of their skills or athletic ability. If you have never done martial arts before or even if you have received a belt elsewhere, come and give us a try! Everyone is welcome!
