Kaizen IBBA of Fort Collins teaches the modern system of International Kenpo Karate Jujitsu. IKKJ was developed as a synthesis of systems both modern and ancient including American Kenpo Karate, Judo/Jujitsu, and Tae Kwon Do kicking skills. Our students learn a well-rounded system that is designed to be age appropriate and can be tailored to an individualâ€™s needs and physical challenges. Students learn practical self-defense skills and those that are interested in competition have many avenues they can pursue. Our school has a character-based leadership curriculum that can provide positive life changes for all ages.
