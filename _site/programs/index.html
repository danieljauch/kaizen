      </header>
      <p class="description"><p>Our Lil’ Dragons class is specifically designed to meet the developmental needs of our youngest students. In addition to building a solid foundation for martial arts training, this class has a strong focus on life skills such as patience, taking turns, self-control, following directions, how to make friends, coordination, mental focus, and confidence.</p>

<p>Our amazing and patient group of instructors loves to work with children. They understand the various challenges kids this age face in trying to focus and their need to become more self-disciplined. Through our IBBA Karate for Kids program, we establish clear rules of proper behavior in class and we encourage the same good behavior at home and in school. At IBBA we have found that delicate balance of fun and clear structure that helps young students to succeed while loving to come to class. Our ultimate aim is to help our students learn not only excellent martial arts skills, but also to set and achieve goals, be well-behaved, and work hard in everything they do.</p>

      </header>
      <p class="description"><p>While laying the foundation for success in martial arts, Tigers play fun games and participate in activities that emphasize self-control, cooperation, respect, confidence, and focus. As Tigers earn their belts by showing proficiency in curriculum and character at tests, but are not quite prepared for the youth program, they are promoted to Advanced Tigers and on to Eagles.</p>

<p>The skills learned in IBBA classes will jump start your child’s success in school and in other sports. The kind, encouraging IBBA Karate instructors teach in a patient and structured manner to help your child have a wonderful experience. Over the years, we have developed a variety of methods to capture children’s imaginations while teaching them important life skills that will set them on a path to succeed in life.</p>
