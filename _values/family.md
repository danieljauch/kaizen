The roots of our arts come from many nationalities and backgrounds. One strong influence of International Kenpo is Hawaiian, which emphasizes the message of “Ohana”. Hawaiians recognize that they all come from the same root, no matter how distantly they are related, like the oha plant and thus are all part of the same family. Generally, ohana is used to describe any group of people with a common bond. Happiness research finds that humans are social creatures and we need to feel like we’re part of a group, that we have support and security. At Kaizen IBBA, we seek to foster that ohana in our school and our community. We welcome diversity in skills, ideas, and backgrounds because we recognize that it is in diversity that we better learn to accept others and grow ourselves. Ohana is much more than just extended family, it is an essential commitment to do everything we can to support our students and families. Hawaiian families understand how ohana – loving and caring for each other - is the glue that holds families together and becomes the social fabric for their islands; we feel the same for our school.
