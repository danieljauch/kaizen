Soke Phillip started his training in Kamishin Jiu Jitsu in 1969 under legendary founder of the system, Senior Grand Master Al Church Jr. On February 1, 2002 Professor Phillip became the 17th inheritor of the system. Nippon Kobudo Kamishin Ryu Jujitsu (Japanese Ancient Martial Way Devine Heart Style) is considered a "non-classical style" that is rich in classical Japanese tradition. This practical form of Jujitsu is known for its flowing movement that takes little to no strength to overcome an aggressor.

SGM Phillip is a much sought after seminar instructor and the Jujitsu teacher of many high-ranking martial artists around the United States. Our own Professor Austin began training under Soke Phillip in 1985 and IBBA's Renshi James Denning is one of Soke Phillip's highest ranking Black Belts in Colorado. Master Phillip's classes are taught in a fun, lighthearted way that makes all students, regardless of age and athletic ability, feel welcome. International Black Belt Academy is honored and proud to have Soke Phillip as part of our teaching staff at both the Fort Collins and Greeley locations. Come try his class!
