description: >-
  Saturday, June 23rd, we will be having a family movie event at the Cinemark on
  Timberline. You can pre-purchase your tickets now for the 2:35pm showing or
  meet us at the theater early to purchase your tickets and snacks. The whole
  family and friends are welcome to join us. 

  Parents, if you would like to use this as your "Parent's Night Out" date
  opportunity, bring your children to the theater at 2:15 to purchase tickets
  and snacks, then sign them in with Mrs. Jauch at the ticket windows by 2:30pm.
  We will walk over to the dojo together after the movie and you can pick your
  children up by 5:15pm.

  Hope to see you there!
