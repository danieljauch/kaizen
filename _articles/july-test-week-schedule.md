title: July test week schedule
description: >-
  No regular class schedule July 16th thru 20th. We will have black belt
  classes, Tai Ji, Kickboxing on Wednesday and Friday, and we have added a white
  belt class so our newest students don't miss out on class this week! Good
  skill on your testing and we'll see you back on regular schedule Saturday, the
  21st.
